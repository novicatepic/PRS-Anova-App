# ANOVA Mini Project

Task: Write a program to use the ANOVA technique and contrast technique.

Methodology: This task is to be done independently. Write a program in any programming language to calculate the parameters of the ANOVA test, allowing input of an arbitrary number of treatments and an arbitrary number of measurements for each treatment. It is desirable for the program to have a graphical interface. Additionally, implement the contrast technique for every two compared treatments.
